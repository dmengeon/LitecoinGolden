# LitecoinGolden

Brief history of LTG
at the end of September, we started the LitecoinGold project.

a new currency no transaction fees, wallet for wallet. 100% free

was not posted immediately on bitcointalk

beginning of October several tests were carried out: shipping / mining / cpu gpu / etc

in the same month, was made the announcement on Bitcointalk

after the announcement, we were able to list on the first exchange.

then it was discovered that the name was copied by a token.

they then made an airdrop, and had many people behind the coin.

unfortunately, the token got the place on coinexchange and then on the coinmarketcap

Our LTG has remained active. wallet working... some miners

the problem is that people confused our currency with the token.

on email, facebook page or even twiter. everyone wanted to know why two coins with the same name.

After saying that LTG is script and mined they would get more confused.

In November the team behind the token began to be denounced in Bitcointalk as SCAM

According to some users, they would have created several tokens, always with the same style and principle.

then the site went offline. twitter was abandoned. becoming a SCAM Token.

coinmarketcap and other exchanges would not add a currency with the name and abbrevationof another

then a new problem arose

the exchange in which LTG was listed possibly it was scam, "coinsmarkets.com".

at least it's what it seems. does not return the contact.

we resolved to return with a new coin, as the same spirit. created based on the erc20 token.
